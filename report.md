# Report for Task 2

There are five states:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
 :------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| A | B | B1 | B2 | B3 |

The state A updates the clock where as the state B updates the clock and chrono.

The light turns on when there is an event signal from the user interface. The light turns off when there is an event signal from the user interface. The light does not turn on for two seconds as was asked in the task description.

In chrono, the features that are working are:

  * Pause 
  * Resume
  * Reset

The time does not update if the background light is on. To achieve time updates when the background light is on, the use of concurrent states would be needed.

The main portion of time spent on this task was used to things unrelated to actually finishing the requested assignment, such as solving technical difficulties. This reduces the value of the exercise as a learning tool, as technical difficulties reduced the time available for studying the course context related topics of the exercise, as well as their implementation.
